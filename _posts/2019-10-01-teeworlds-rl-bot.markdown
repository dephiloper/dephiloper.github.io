description: During a university course, a reinforcement learning environment
    was developed for the game Teeworlds. The Deep Q-learning algorithm was
    applied to a simplified form of the game with the aim of completing several
    self-created test levels. The environment was developed with python and the
    machine learning ecosystem pytorch. This project was carried out together
    with a fellow student.
