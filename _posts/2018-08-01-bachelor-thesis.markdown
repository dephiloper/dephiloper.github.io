description: My bachelor thesis focused on the comparison of artificial
    intelligence algorithms in immersive video games. The practical
    part of the thesis addressed the development of a prototypical racing
    game, which was designed for the use in a virtual reality
    environment. In addition to the theoretical basics of artificial
    intelligence and VR simulations, the individual functions of AI
    technologies in games were examined in more detail. Finally, an opinion
    poll was conducted to assess which of the AI procedures implemented
    could have the most natural effect on the player.
