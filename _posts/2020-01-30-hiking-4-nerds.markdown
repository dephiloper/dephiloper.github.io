description: This app was developed within one semester for a project assignment
  in a group of 7 students. The main task was to develop a hiking route app, which
  offers the user round hiking routes with interesting stops. The app was developed in the
  Cross-Platform Framework Flutter with the programming language Dart. One of the main features
  of the app is that it only uses map material and geodata from Open-Street-Map. Furthermore,
  all map data is hosted on a university server to avoid dependence on external services.
