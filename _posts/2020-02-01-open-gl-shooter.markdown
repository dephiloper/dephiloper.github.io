description: This game was developed in a university course.
  The specifications were that a game should be developed which should have real-time network communication. To build up knowledge in the field of graphics programming and engine development, a 3D shooter with
  OpenGL, GLFW and GLEW was developed, which ensures simple collisions as well as raycasting
  to allow players to hit each other.
