description: Gravity Warrior is a 2D couch-coop twin-stick shooter
    in which the player controls one of four characters (called Gravity Warrior),
    which is equipped with a jet pack and a plasma gun. Besides controlling the
    warrior and firing the plasma gun, gravity is the core mechanics of the game.
    The gravitational force is generated by the asteroids in the game and
    influences both the player and his projectiles. Gravity Warrior was developed
    as a university project in a team of four students with the use of the game
    engine <a href='https://godotengine.org/'>Godot</a>. (Tumbnail image by Tom
