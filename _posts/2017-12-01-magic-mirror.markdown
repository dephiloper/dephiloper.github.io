description: For a friend I've developed with the help of others a magic mirror
    application in JavaFX, which shows the current time, a timeline for train stations
    nearby and dates in the calendar. A monitor was inserted into a specially made
    wooden housing and afterwards a mirror glass was mounted at the face of the
    housing in front of the monitor. The application was then run on a Raspberry Pi,
    which was connected to the monitor and automatically launches the mirrorapplication
    at system startup. (Currently there are no pictures available, they will be added
    later.)
