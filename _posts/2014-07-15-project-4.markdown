description: This scientific thesis focuses on the comparison of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms in immersive video games. The practical part achieves the development of a prototypical racing game, which was designed for use in a virtual reality (VR) environment. In addition to the theoretical basics of artificial intelligence and VR simulations, the individual functions of AI technologies in games are examined in more detail. Finally, an opinion poll is carried out in which it is evaluated which of the implemented AI procedures can achieve the most natural effect on the player.
