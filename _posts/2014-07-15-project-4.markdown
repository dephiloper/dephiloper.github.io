description: Stuck in a Loop is a rythm game developed during the 2018 Nordic Game Jam. The aim of the game is to live through two independent day sequences together with a friend or a stranger in order to meet and dance at a party. The better the processes during the day, the more successful the meeting at the party will be, until you finally make the bond of friendship.
