description: Gravity Warrior is a 2D couch-coop twin-stick shooter in which the player controls one of four characters (called Gravity Warrior), which is equipped with a jet pack and a plasma gun. Besides controlling the Warrior and firing the plasma gun, gravity is the core mechanics of the game. The gravitational force is generated by the asteroids in the game and influences both the player and his projectiles.
