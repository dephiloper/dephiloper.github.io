description: Stuck in a Loop is a rythm game developed during the 2018
    Nordic Game Jam. The aim of the game is to live through two independent
    day sequences together with a friend or a stranger in order to meet and
    dance at a party. The better the processes during the day, the more
    successful the meeting at the party will be, until they finally make the
    bond of friendship. Stuck in a Loop was developed by six buddies and the
    help of the <a href='https://godotengine.org/'>Godot</a> game engine.
